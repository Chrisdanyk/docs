What's new and noteworthy? 
===========================

* *Conflict detection on REST endpoints*: Our REST endpoints are smarter! Now it checks if the provided ID matches with the entity/DTO submitted in the PUT request.
* *UI API improvements*: We have introduced an awesome extension point (_UIDesktop_) that allows better control when opening files inside your IDE (eg: typing _open pom.xml_ will now use the IDE's editor and _open https://github.com/JBoss-Dockerfiles/forge _ will use the IDE's browser configuration).
* *Component Upgrades*: We've upgraded Roaster to 2.11.0.Final

And much more! Check the release notes below
