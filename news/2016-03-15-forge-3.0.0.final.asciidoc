== JBoss Forge 3.0.0.Final is here!

After ~1 year of hard work, the Forge Team is proud to announce the immediate availability of JBoss Forge 3.0.0.Final. This is the best and most stable release ever and we're pretty sure you'll have lots of fun, as much as we had enhancing it. 

Head to the link:http://forge.jboss.org/download[Downloads] page and grab it now!

What's new and noteworthy? 
===========================

* *JDK 8*: The minimum requirement for running Forge 3.0.0.Final is now the Java Development Kit 8.0. Hello lambdas and JDK 8 specific features!

* *Option names are now more unix-like*: Eg: `--targetPackage` is now `--target-package`. Scripts targeted for 2.x may fail. The solution is to adjust the script manually for now.

* *Stacks*: Starting in this version we have added support for Stacks. 
** What is a stack? 
*** A stack is simply a group of supported technologies for a given project. In Forge it is modeled as a Project facet including a set of project facets.
** This looks great, how do I use it? 
- The `Project: New` command introduces a `Stack` parameter. For example, if you create a new project using the JavaEE 7 stack, you no longer need to specify the spec versions while setting them up, also making only the supported JavaEE 7 commands to be enabled for a given project. Imagine the possibilities! :)

* *Command line information*: If you always wanted to know which options where provided to your command when running in shell, you can using the newest `ShellContext.getCommandLine()` API.  

* *Selected index for UISelect components*: Now it's possible to know which index was selected in a UISelectOne or UISelectMany component. The ValueChangeEvent class has also been changed to include this information.

* *Better support for creation of generic projects*: Not every project is in Java nowadays (unfortunately), so we are introducing a new addon (project-generic) that should allow you to create commands for non-Java projects more easily.

* *Project type naming change*: We renamed the `addon` project type to `forge-addon`. As it only affects the shell UI, make sure to use `project-new --named demo --type forge-addon` when creating a new addon project type; 

* *SLF4J classloader conflicts*: The Git addon was erroneously bundling the slf4j-api, causing some classloader conflicts. 

IMPORTANT: If your addon uses SLF4J, add a dependency to the link::http://forge.jboss.org/addon/org.jboss.forge.addon:slf4j[SLF4J addon] and exclude any dependencies to the SLF4J jars from your addon's pom.xml

* *Enhanced Project creation using Maven archetypes*: Now Forge allows you to create projects from Maven archetypes which don't use Maven (Forge won't create the `pom.xml` and `src/main/java` unless the archetype does it).

* *Component Upgrades*: We have upgraded to Furnace 2.23.3.Final and also Roaster to 2.18.3.Final.
