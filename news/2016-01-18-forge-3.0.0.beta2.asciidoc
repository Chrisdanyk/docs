== Forge 3.0.0.Beta2 is here!

Happy new year! Time for another exciting release!
The Forge Team is proud to announce the immediate availability of JBoss Forge 3.0.0.Beta2.

Head to the link:http://forge.jboss.org/download[Downloads] page and grab it now!

What's new and noteworthy? 
===========================

* *Stacks*: Starting in this version we have added support for Stacks. 
** What is a stack? 
*** A stack is simply a group of supported technologies for a given project. In Forge it is modeled as a Project facet including a set of project facets.
** This looks great, how do I use it? 
- The `Project: New` command introduces a `Stack` parameter. For example, if you create a new project using the JavaEE 7 stack, you no longer need to specify the spec versions while setting them up, also making only the supported JavaEE 7 commands to be enabled for a given project. Imagine the possibilities! :)

* *Command line information*: If you always wanted to know which options where provided to your command when running in shell, you can using the newest `ShellContext.getCommandLine()` API.  

* *Component Upgrades*: We have upgraded Roaster to 2.18.0.Final and Hibernate Validator to 5.3.0.Alpha1

As usual, stay tuned for more features on the next release.
