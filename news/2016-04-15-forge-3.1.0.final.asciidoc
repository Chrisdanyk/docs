What's new and noteworthy? 
===========================

* *Generate entities from tables allow catalog and schema selection*: To facilitate filtering, it's now possible to choose the catalog and schema of a database when choosing the tables to be imported. We have also improved the performance when fetching the table names.
* *New commands*: Introducing a `java-generate-serialversionuid` to calculate and place the serialVersionUID field in any given class.
* *JavaTargetFacet*: We introduced a JavaTargetFacet in order to provide the path to the compiled sources. This is useful when used together with ClassLoaderFacet to build a unified classloader for the project classes.
* *Component Upgrades*: We upgraded to Roaster to 2.18.6.Final.
