What's new and noteworthy? 
===========================

This version features all the bug fixes from 2.20.1.Final, plus the following:

* *JDK 8*: The minimum requirement for running Forge 3.0.0.Alpha1 is now the Java Development Kit 8.0. Hello lambdas and JDK 8 specific features!
* *Option names are now more unix-like*: Eg: `--targetPackage` is now `--target-package`. Scripts targeted for 2.x may fail. The solution is to adjust the script manually for now.
* *Component Upgrades*: We have upgraded Furnace to 2.22.7.Final and Roaster to 2.17.2.Final. 

Stay tuned for more features on the next release.
