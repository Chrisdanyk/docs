== Forge 3.0.0.Beta1 is here!

Christmas has come, and so the first Beta version. 
The Forge Team is proud to announce the immediate availability of JBoss Forge 3.0.0.Beta.

Head to the link:http://forge.jboss.org/download[Downloads] page and grab it now!

What's new and noteworthy? 
===========================

* *Better support for creation of generic projects*: Not every project is in Java nowadays (unfortunately), so we are introducing a new addon (project-generic) that should allow you to create commands for non-Java projects more easily.
* *Component Upgrades*: We have upgraded Furnace to 2.22.10.Final and Roaster to 2.17.4.Final

Stay tuned for more features on the next release.
