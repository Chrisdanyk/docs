== Forge 2.20.0.Final (Silver) is here!

The Forge Team is proud to announce the immediate availability of JBoss Forge 2.20.0.Final.

Head to the link:http://forge.jboss.org/download[Downloads] page and grab it now!

What's new and noteworthy? 
===========================

* *Better performance*: We improved the performance of the CDI container, by enabling https://github.com/wildfly/jandex[Jandex]. The core addons contain now a Jandex index generated automatically using the https://github.com/wildfly/jandex-maven-plugin[jandex-maven-plugin].
* *Deprecate your old commands and options*: Forge now allows you to mark a command or an option as deprecated, thus discouraging its usage from users. That allows you to focus on new and improved commands without breaking compatibility. Just add a `@Deprecated` annotation on top of it or call `UIInput.setDeprecated(true)` and you should be set. Take a look of it in action:

What's next? 
============

This is the last 2.x version with new features. Future 2.x versions will focus primarily on bug fixes. The Forge team is right now working hard on the next release *3.0.0.Alpha1* (release date still TBD), which will include, among another things:

* *JDK 8 as a minimum requirement*: the Forge sources will now take full advantage of the JDK 8 features. 
* *Option names are now more unix-like*: Eg: `--targetPackage` is now `--target-package`.
