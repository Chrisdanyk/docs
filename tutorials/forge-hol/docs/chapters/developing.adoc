== Developing Forge


=== Developing a web application in few seconds

=== Developing Hibernate Envers addon

http://envers.jboss.org/[Hibernate Envers] is a Hibernate core module that enables auditing of persistence classes.
If you want to audit the history of all the changes made to a certain entity or one of its fields during the web
application runtime, you just need to audit that with `@Audited`. Envers will create a separate table for each such
entity, which will hold the changes made to it. +

In this lab we will develop a Forge addon with the following features:

* Setup Envers for the following project by adding its dependency to the POM
* Enable auditing an entity by adding the `@Audited` annotation on class level

==== Creating a new Forge addon

Creating a new Forge addon is similar to any new project that you want to create. You can do it manually, you can copy
and modify an existing project of the same type or you can use a wizard to do it for you. We would certainly recommend
using Forge to help you bootstrap everything for several reasons. It knows what exactly which dependencies and artifacts
you need as a start so you will not miss anything. Forge will also not create any garbage in your new project. +

Before creating the Envers addon, you need to start Forge. Please make sure that you have followed the instructions
in <<installing-forge>> before that. You can create a new addon if you run the following command in the Forge CLI: +

[code, script]
----
project-new --named envers --type addon --topLevelPackage org.jboss.forge.addon --addons org.jboss.forge.addon:javaee,2.12.0.Final
----

If you run Forge from JBDS, open the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) then select _Project: New_ and specify
_envers_ as project name, _org.jboss.forge.addon_ as top level package, enter project location per your preference and
as a Project type select _Forge Addon_:

image::developing/forge-new-project.png[title="Creating new addon project"]

This will create an empty Maven project that has the following artifacts:

* *pom.xml* where the top level package is the group ID and the project name is the artifact ID. Besides the minimum
Forge dependencies, the command will add also those that you have specified with the `--addons` option in the format
<group-id>:<artifact-id>,<version>
* *Standard maven directory structure* plus the top level package
* *Empty +beans.xml+* in the +src/main/resources/META-INF+ directory. This is because Forge and its addons strongly
rely on the CDI development model
* *README.asciidoc* file with a standard skeleton for documenting Forge addons

==== Developing the "Envers: Setup" command

The first command that we are going to create will set up Envers for a project. This basically means that the command
will simply add the Envers library dependency to the current project POM. As with the new Forge addon, we can manually
write the command class, copy and modify an existing command or let Forge itself generated it for us. Here we will go
for the third option.

If you are running from the command line interface, type in: +

[code, script]
----
addon-new-ui-command --named EnversSetupCommand --commandName "Envers: Setup" --categories "Auditing"
----

While from the JBDS, after opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac), you should choose _Addon: New UI Command_
and enter _EnversSetupCommand_ in the Type Name field, _Envers: Setup_ in the Command name field and add _Auditing_ to
the Categories list box: +

image::developing/forge-envers-setup-command.png[title="Creating _Envers: Setup_ command"]

This will generate `EnversSetupCommand` class in the `org.jboss.forge.addon.commands` package (unless you didn't specify
explicitly anything else). Forge makes this class extend `AbstractUICommand`, which provides some basic functionality
like configuring the command name, the command dialog and the command execution. We will go through these in this and
the next few sections. +

The `getMetadata()` method should be already implemented by Forge:

[source, java]
----
   @Override
   public UICommandMetadata getMetadata(UIContext context)
   {
      return Metadata.forCommand(EnversSetupCommand.class).name(
            "Envers: Setup").category(Categories.create("Auditing"));
   }
----

This will basically create a command that can be called _envers-setup_ from the CLI (note the substitution of colons and
spaces by hyphens) and as _Envers: Setup_ in the _Auditing_ category in the Forge wizard: +

image::developing/forge-envers-setup-command-wizard.png[title="_Envers: Setup_ command in the _Auditing_ category"]

As the newly created command will not require any input from the user, we will leave the `initializeUI` method empty.
However, in order to implement the command execution, we will need to change a little bit our class. More precisely we
will have to extend from another abstract command class. The rationale behind this is that we want to update the
*current* project POM. Extending `AbstractProjectCommand` instead of `AbstractUICommand` will give us some handy
methods to access and manipulate the project configuration:

[source, java]
----
public class EnversSetupCommand extends AbstractProjectCommand
{
----

We will have to implement two more abstract methods coming from this parent class:

[source, java]
----
   @Override
   protected boolean isProjectRequired() 
   {
      return true;
   }

   @Inject
   private ProjectFactory projectFactory;

   @Override
   protected ProjectFactory getProjectFactory() 
   {
       return projectFactory;
   }
----

After having specified _Envers: Setup_ as a project command, we can proceed to implementing the `execute` method.
Usually this is called when the user clicks Finish on the command dialog or in our case where we don't require input:
when the user selects the command from the Forge wizard. +

As we mentioned earlier, the command will have to add the Hibernate Envers dependency to the project. We are going to
build the Forge representation of this dependency using the DependencyBuilder's utility methods:

[source, java]
----
   @Override
   public Result execute(UIExecutionContext context) throws Exception
   {
      Dependency dependency = 
            DependencyBuilder.create("org.hibernate")
                             .setArtifactId("hibernate-envers")
                             .setVersion("4.3.6.Final")
                             .setScopeType("provided");
   }

----

Speaking in Maven terms, this is a dependency to artifact with ID +hibernate-envers+, coming from the +org.hibernate+
group, having version 4.3.6.Final and going into the project's _provided_ scope. +

After we have specified our dependency, we will have to add it to the project model. For that purpose we will use the
`DependencyInstaller` utility, coming from the projects addon:

[source, java]
----
   @Inject
   private DependencyInstaller dependencyInstaller;
----

Forge 2.0 is based on modular runtime called _Furnace_. The core of Furnace itself is not bound to any development model,
so the addons can decide which of the Furnace implementations it wants to use. We created our addon with the default
configuration which enables the CDI development model. That is why we asked in the code snippet above Forge to provide
us with the dependency installer for the current project build system. +

Now it is time to install our dependency:

[source, java]
----
   @Override
   public Result execute(UIExecutionContext context) throws Exception
   {
      Dependency dependency =
            DependencyBuilder.create("org.hibernate")
                             .setArtifactId("hibernate-envers")
                             .setVersion("4.3.6.Final")
                             .setScopeType("provided");
      dependencyInstaller.install(getSelectedProject(context), dependency);

   }
----

We are using here one of the helper methods provided by the `AbstractProjectCommand`: `getSelectedProject()`. +

Now our job is done, so it is time to report what we did. We do it by returning the result:

[source, java]
----
   @Override
   public Result execute(UIExecutionContext context) throws Exception
   {
      Dependency dependency =
            DependencyBuilder.create("org.hibernate")
                             .setArtifactId("hibernate-envers")
                             .setVersion("4.3.6.Final")
                             .setScopeType("provided");
      dependencyInstaller.install(getSelectedProject(context), dependency);
      return Results.success("Envers was successfully setup for the current project!");
   }
----

This will result in a SUCCESS: message in the command line interface and a green popup in the JDBS after our command is
executed. +

Now that we have a command the enables Hibernate Envers, it is time to add another command that will turn on auditing
for a given JPA entity.

==== Developing the "Envers: Audit entity" command

We will create the class for the new command in the same way that we created the one for "Envers: Setup": with the help
of Forge. If you are running the CLI, then simply type:

[code, script]
----
addon-new-ui-command --named EnversAuditEntityCommand --commandName "Envers: Audit entity" --categories "Auditing"
----

Or alternatively in the JBDS choose _Addon: New UI Command_, enter _EnversAuditEntityCommand_ in the Type Name field,
_Envers: Audit entity_ in the Command name field and add _Auditing_ to the Categories list box: +

image::developing/forge-envers-audit-entity-command.png[title="Creating _Envers: Audit entity_ command"]

Then open the newly created class and make it extend `AbstractProjectCommand` instead of `AbstractUICommand` and also
add the unimplemented methods the way you did it in the setup command. +

This command will have to receive as input the entity class that has to be audited. To achieve this, we need to do two
things:

. Obtain and configure a `UIInput` object from Furnace
. Add our input to the `UIBuilder` in the `initializeUI` method

Starting from number one, we should add the following member field to our command class:

[source, java]
----
   @Inject
   @WithAttributes(label = "Entity to audit", required = true)
   private UIInput<JavaResource> auditEntity;
----

Here we call our field auditEntity. This automatically will add a `--auditEntity` option to our command in the CLI.
The type of the field is `UIInput<JavaResource>`, which means a few things:

* The JBDS integration will create a text box control for the audit entity, while the command line interface will expect
a single unbounded value
* The type of the value for this option should be a file that represents a Java type (class, interface or enumeration)

We have also specified some additional attributes with the `@WithAttributes` annotation:

* The `label` attribute tells Forge's JBDS integration to override the field name (`auditEntity` in this case) with
_Entity to audit_. This will be the actual label of the text box in the IDE. This will not however change the option
name on the command line
* The `required` attribute will not let the user complete the dialog without entering a value for the entity. The well
known asterisk character will be displayed along the label in JBDS

After we defined the input field, it is time to add it to the command dialog. In order to do that, we should edit the
`initializeUI` method:

[source, java]
----
   @Override
   public void initializeUI(UIBuilder builder) throws Exception
   {
      builder.add(auditEntity);
   }
----

We can tell now Forge to show a _Browse_ button to the right of the input field, which will open the well known
type picker of Eclipse:

[source, java]
----
   @Override
   public void initializeUI(UIBuilder builder) throws Exception
   {
      auditEntity.getFacet(HintsFacet.class).setInputType(InputType.JAVA_CLASS_PICKER);
      builder.add(auditEntity);
   }
----

In Forge you can also set default values for a certain input. This way you can omit specifying its value on the command
line and in the IDE it will be pre-filled in the command dialog. You can do that with the `setDefaultValue` method of the
`UIInput`. In our case the UIInput is generified over the JavaResource class. So we'll have to check whether the current
selection in the UI (being the CLI or JBDS) is a file that represents a Java type. If yes, we will set it as the default
value of the text field:

[source, java]
----
   @Override
   public void initializeUI(UIBuilder builder) throws Exception
   {
      auditEntity.getFacet(HintsFacet.class).setInputType(InputType.JAVA_CLASS_PICKER);
      Object selection = builder.getUIContext().getInitialSelection().get();
      if (selection instanceof JavaResource)
         auditEntity.setDefaultValue((JavaResource) selection);
      builder.add(auditEntity);
   }
----

Now the UI of the command is ready. We can go on and implement the `execute` method. First we should get the value
entered in the text field and convert it to `JavaResource`. Then we will extract the `JavaClassSource` out of it so
that we can manipulate things like annotations:

[source, java]
----
   @Override
   public Result execute(UIExecutionContext context) throws Exception
   {
      JavaResource javaResource = auditEntity.getValue().reify(JavaResource.class);
      JavaClassSource javaClass = javaResource.getJavaType();

   }
----

Next we will check whether the chosen class has already the `Audited` annotation and if not, will add it to that. At the
end we'll save the new content and will return successful result:

[source, java]
----
   @Override
   public Result execute(UIExecutionContext context) throws Exception
   {
      JavaResource javaResource = auditEntity.getValue().reify(JavaResource.class);
      JavaClassSource javaClass = javaResource.getJavaType();
      if (!javaClass.hasAnnotation("org.hibernate.envers.Audited")) {
         javaClass.addAnnotation("org.hibernate.envers.Audited");
      }
      javaResource.setContents(javaClass);
      return Results.success(
          "Entity " + javaClass.getQualifiedName() + " was successfully audited");
   }
----

But what if the user enters invalid input? This could be a file that does not exist, or is not a class or is not a JPA
entity. We'll implement the `validate(UIValidationContext validator)` method to handle such situations. Whenever it
finds illegal input, it will add a validation error to the `validator` parameter. This will bring an error message if
the command executes in the CLI and in JBDS will disable the Finish button of the dialog, showing the error message in
its well known location. This is how we implement the method:

[source, java]
----
   @Override
   public void validate(UIValidationContext validator)
   {
      super.validate(validator);
      try
      {
         if (!auditEntity.getValue().reify(JavaResource.class).getJavaType()
               .hasAnnotation(Entity.class))
         {
            validator.addValidationError(auditEntity,
                  "The selected class has to be JPA entity");
         }
      }
      catch (FileNotFoundException e)
      {
         validator.addValidationError(auditEntity,
               "You must select existing JPA entity to audit");
      }
   }
----

Finally, we want to avoid some compilation errors in the project where we will run this command. So it should be only
available for execution if the user has called the setup command first, i.e. if the current project has dependency to
Hibernate Envers. You can implement this enabling and disabling in several ways. We will show one of these: by
implementing the `isEnabled` method. There we will again obtain the `DependencyFacet` and will ask it whether the
desired dependency is installed. If this method returns false, the Forge commands wizard will not list the Audit entity
command and it will not be available in the command completion in CLI. This is the implementation:

[source, java]
----
   @Override
   public boolean isEnabled(UIContext context)
   {
      Dependency dependency = DependencyBuilder
                               .create("org.hibernate")
                               .setArtifactId("hibernate-envers")
      return getSelectedProject(context).getFacet(DependencyFacet.class)
               .hasEffectiveDependency(dependency);
   }
----

Our first addon is ready. We can now build it, deploy it and run it on the Java EE project that we created in the
beginning of this chapter.
